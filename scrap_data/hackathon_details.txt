THE ANALYTICS HACKATHON 2025
Challenge Overview
You are an Analyst at AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company that sells products through online and reseller channels. Management wants to understand business performance, customer behavior, and product trends.
Your task is to:
Explore and analyze the AdventureWorks dataset.
Identify five (5) high-quality insights that have business relevance.
Support each insight with evidence — queries, visualizations, and reasoning.
Document your process and prepare a presentation-ready report.

Tools to Use
You may use any combination of the following tools:
SQL – for data exploration, querying, and extraction.
Excel – for cleaning, quick analysis, or visualization.
Power BI – for interactive dashboards and storytelling.
Python – for deeper analysis, automation, or visualization.
PowerPoint / Google Slides – for your final presentation.
Note: Your choice and combination of tools depend on you — use what best supports your analytical process and storytelling.

Dataset
Use the AdventureWorks sample database (2019 or 2022 version).
You can restore it from Microsoft’s SQL Server samples or online repositories.
Tables of interest may include:
Sales.SalesOrderHeader
Sales.SalesOrderDetail
Production.Product
Sales.Customer
Sales.SalesTerritory
Person.Person
HumanResources.Employee

Deliverables
Each participant or team should submit the following:
SQL Scripts – all queries used for data exploration and insight generation.
Documentation Report – a structured document (Word, Markdown, or PDF) containing:
Each insight’s objective/question
SQL logic or method used
Key findings and interpretation
Business implication or recommendation
Dashboard or Visual Report – built using Excel, Power BI, or Python (matplotlib/seaborn).
Presentation Slides – 3–5 slides summarizing your top insights, ready for presentation.

{This report presents a comprehensive analysis of AdventureWorks' sales and product data to diagnose profitability issues and recommend operational remedies. Using transaction-level sales (Fact\_Sales) and product metadata, the study compares Online and Reseller channels, segments customers with an RFM framework, conducts market-basket and product-level profitability analyses, and evaluates discount sensitivity.

Key findings show a pronounced profitability paradox: the Reseller channel contributes roughly 73\% of revenue yet frequently operates at negative margins, while the Online channel consistently delivers much higher profit rates (around 40\%). RFM segmentation identifies a concentrated value base where Champions (≈5.5\%) and Loyal customers account for a large share of revenue. Product analysis highlights profitable "hero" SKUs (e.g., Mountain-200 series) offset by loss-making "laggards" (notably the Road-250 series). Discounting behavior is a central driver of losses — deep discounts (>30\%) can invert margins (example: Mountain Bikes suffer losses on the order of \$800+ per unit under extreme discounting). Market-basket analysis uncovers clear bundling opportunities that can improve average order value without eroding unit margins.

Recommendations include an urgent profitability audit for high-revenue but low-margin SKUs, enforcing discount ceilings (suggested 15\% floor for high-value categories) with approval gates, redesigning reseller incentives to reward net margin rather than gross revenue, and deploying targeted retention campaigns aligned to the observed 161‑day repeat-purchase window. The analysis is reproducible via provided SQL views and is paired with operational suggestions designed to restore sustainable profitability and growth.}
