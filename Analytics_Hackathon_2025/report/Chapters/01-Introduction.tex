AdventureWorks operates as a global manufacturing entity, distributing products through a dual-channel strategy comprising an online direct-to-consumer interface and a robust reseller network. This report showcases findings from analysis of the business from 3 lenses: channel performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The objective is to identify actionable insights of business relevance, backed by quantitative evidence.

\section{Business Performance Overview}

Intial exploratory data analysis of the dataset reveals a business with a substantial market footprint. The aggregate financial and operational metrics indicate a mature operation with a significant customer base. As detailed in \autoref{tab:kpi_summary}, the company has processed sales amounting to nearly \$110 million, serving over 19,000 customers with a high Average Order Value (AOV).

        \toprule

        \midrule
        Total Revenue & \$109.85 M \\
        Total Profit & \$9.37 M \\
        Total Customers & 19.12 K \\
        Average Order Value (AOV) & \$3.49 K \\

\end{table}

\section{Channel Distribution}

The revenue stream of the business is bifurcated into Reseller and Online channels. \autoref{fig:revenue_by_channel} illustrates the volume of the Reseller channel, contributing the majority of gross revenue.

As presented in \autoref{tab:channel_revenue}, the Reseller channel generated approximately \$80.5 million, while the Online channel contributed \$29.4 million. This distribution suggests a B2B-centric business model where bulk purchasing or wholesale agreements has the greatest impact on financial performance.

% \section{Temporal Revenue Trends}

% The temporal analysis of revenue from 2011 through 2014 highlights distinct growth trajectories for both channels.

% \subsection{Growth Phase (2011--2013)}
% The fiscal period beginning in Q2 2011 marked the initial intake of revenue, with the Reseller channel quickly outpacing Online sales.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{2011:} The Reseller channel demonstrated aggressive growth, expanding from \$489k in Q2 to \$4.74M by Q4. Online sales showed steady but more modest growth, ending the year at \$1.9M in Q4.
%     \item \textbf{2012:} Both channels stabilized, with Reseller revenues consistently ranging between \$5.8M and \$7.7M per quarter.
%     \item \textbf{2013:} This year represented the peak performance period. Reseller revenue surged, hitting a high of \$9.82M in Q3 2013. Online revenue also saw its highest values, reaching \$4.3M in Q4 2013.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Consolidation and Decline (2014)}
% The first half of 2014 shows a shift in momentum. While Q1 2014 maintained strong figures (Reseller: \$8.27M; Online: \$4.58M), Q2 2014 indicates a significant contraction, particularly in the Reseller market, which dropped to \$3.42M. Data for Q3 and Q4 2014 is currently absent, suggesting either a reporting lag or a cessation of the analyzed period.

% This trend analysis suggests that while the Reseller channel is the primary revenue engine, it is also subject to higher volatility compared to the relatively stable Online channel.
