THE ANALYTICS HACKATHON 2025
Challenge Overview
You are an Analyst at AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company that sells products through online and reseller channels. Management wants to understand business performance, customer behavior, and product trends.
Your task is to:
Explore and analyze the AdventureWorks dataset.
Identify five (5) high-quality insights that have business relevance.
Support each insight with evidence — queries, visualizations, and reasoning.
Document your process and prepare a presentation-ready report.

Tools to Use
You may use any combination of the following tools:
SQL – for data exploration, querying, and extraction.
Excel – for cleaning, quick analysis, or visualization.
Power BI – for interactive dashboards and storytelling.
Python – for deeper analysis, automation, or visualization.
PowerPoint / Google Slides – for your final presentation.
Note: Your choice and combination of tools depend on you — use what best supports your analytical process and storytelling.

Dataset
Use the AdventureWorks sample database (2019 or 2022 version).
You can restore it from Microsoft’s SQL Server samples or online repositories.
Tables of interest may include:
Sales.SalesOrderHeader
Sales.SalesOrderDetail
Production.Product
Sales.Customer
Sales.SalesTerritory
Person.Person
HumanResources.Employee

Deliverables
Each participant or team should submit the following:
SQL Scripts – all queries used for data exploration and insight generation.
Documentation Report – a structured document (Word, Markdown, or PDF) containing:
Each insight’s objective/question
SQL logic or method used
Key findings and interpretation
Business implication or recommendation
Dashboard or Visual Report – built using Excel, Power BI, or Python (matplotlib/seaborn).
Presentation Slides – 3–5 slides summarizing your top insights, ready for presentation.

I need you to prepare a detailed plan for me on how to present winning deliverables based on the judging criteria.

Curate an interesting business case.
 
 Choose 3 themes of the business case for the analysis to revolve around to give the analysis structure and a storyline. 

 Do you think it is necessary for me to create more summarised tables in another schema to display my data engineering skills? Or the OLTP tables are enough to derive insights?

 Then if we need to create more summarised views, then provides the script for that. Ensure that the data captured in them is sufficient enough for the analysis.

 Afterwards, based on your understanding of the schema in schema.txt, generate 5 - 10 questions under each theme and write sql statements to answer the questions. The questions to be explored should be deep enough so that they can be solved with advanced SQL techniques like CTEs, joins, Case statements, aggregrations and other advanced sql analytical techniques.

Use a neat folder structure for the scripts
